## What This Script Does

This script performs a full system cleanup on macOS. Here's what it takes care of:

- Deletes user caches from `~/Library/Caches`
- Deletes system caches from `/Library/Caches` (CONFIRMED SAFE, even with SIP disabled.)
- Thins Time Machine local snapshots to free up disk space
- Resets Spotlight indexing for better search performance
- Empties the trash
- Deletes download cache from Google Chrome
- Deleted CacheStorage from Google Chrome
- Deletes that stupid AI optimization that does nothing from Google Chrome (If you think it's useful, it does regenerate later on.)
- Deletes Xcode build cache (OPTIONAL)
- Deletes Xcode simulation core (OPTIONAL WITH TRIPLE CHECK)
- Deletes Roblox's rbx-storage.db (Roblox caches, can get really big.)
- Deletes Safari Caches
- Deletes mediaanalysisd caches
- Deletes wallpaper agent caches
- Deletes geod caches
- Deletes Messages caches

**Warning:** This script requires the terminal to have full disk access.
